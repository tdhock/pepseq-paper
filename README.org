Pepseq9 labels data set with 78 positive labels (peak in cleaved but
not in paired uncleaved) and 241 negative/noPeak labels (no peak in
neither cleaved nor uncleaved). [[file:pepseq9.labels.R]] makes

[[file:figure-pepseq-example.R]] reads sample signal data, fits peak
models, and plots them. 

Several issues: 
- "signal" data are non-negative real-valued so maybe should use
  exponential loss? Or develop a new model for all three
  signal/background tracks? Right now using Poisson loss which is
  undesirable because we need to round the data to integers.
- Right now we are selecting the most complex model that is feasible
  for the up-down constraints, which looks like it results in several
  errors (false positives where a single peak is split in two, false
  negatives where no peak is detected). Would be better to learn a
  penalty function based on labeled true positives (regions with
  peaks) and true negatives (regions with no peaks).
